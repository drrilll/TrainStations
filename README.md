# TrainStations
An animation of a problem we are working on, the minimum number of colours necessary so that different length trains running 
orthogonally do not intersect. The square layout represents the lower bound we found, and it is useful for finding an upper
bound. 
This is simply source files for now, built in IntelliJ IDEA community edition. I will likely add a jar when it is complete, 
although it is pretty close at the moment. 

There are two layouts available, square and diagonal. The square is the "hardest" version of the problem, with which we have
produced our lower bounds and are working on our upper bounds. When entering something into a textfield, you must press enter
to have it take effect. The "Optimal Colouring" button produces an optimal colouring only for trains of length 2. For other
lengths it will produce a colouring, but that colouring will result in collisions.

There are various controls for pause, play, and to adjust the time. These are self-explanatory.
